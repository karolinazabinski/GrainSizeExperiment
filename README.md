# Abstract from Manuscript:  
1.	Interactions between local adaptation and plasticity shape population differentiation in response to stressors throughout a speciesâ€™ range. In addition, there is gaining interest in understanding how microbes may play a role in mitigating organismal performance by extending phenotypes. 
2.	Here, we use a common garden mesocosm experiment to assess eelgrass (Zostera marina) plastic and fixed adaptive responses to sediment grain size, considering not only variation in plant traits but also variation in the plant-associated microbiome that may contribute to eelgrass growth and reproductive success. 
3.	We found consistent fixed differences in plant traits from the two populations, as plants from the clay-dominated, fine-grained site maintained greater above and below ground biomass regardless of sediment type. 
4.	We also found plasticity in both populations. Clay-dominated sediment increased root length and clonal side shoot size compared to the larger grained, sand-dominated sediment. 
5.	Plant by sediment origin interactions indicated some measure of home site advantage with respect to sediment conditions. Specifically, plants from both populations reduced porewater sulfide to low levels in fine-grained sediment, but only plants native to sand-dominated sediment decreased porewater sulfide in the coarse-grained treatment.
6.	This home site advantage may be mediated by microbiome differences between populations as plants native to clay-dominated sediment had approximately half the relative abundance of a dominant sulfur oxidizer, Sulfurimonadaceae, compared to plants native to sand-dominated sediment when grown in sediment from the coarse-grained site. 
7.	Synthesis: These results support that sediment partially mediates home site advantage in eelgrass populations and suggest differential population responses may be mediated by the associated microbial community.
